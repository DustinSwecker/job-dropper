# JOB-DROPPER

## Description

Job Dropper is a site for people who want to help their friends. For job seekers to see curated lists of jobs shared by buddies.Because all other social networking sites are too formal and take too long, require too much information and are too focused on attracting business interests and not just serving the public and the social needs of those looking for jobs. We want to make job search social in a way it hasn't been done before.
